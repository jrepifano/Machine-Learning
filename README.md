# Machine-Learning
This Repository contains all of the alogorithms I have worked on during my Machine Learning clinic at Rowan University.

The course is taught by Dr. Robi Polikar. His bio can be found [here](http://users.rowan.edu/~polikar/)

The main focus of the course is to introduce students to many of the common machine learning algorithms and classifiers.

Algorithms that I wrote by hand are tested using synthetic datasets. 

Large datasets are tested using MATLAB's built in functions for its respective classifer. The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
